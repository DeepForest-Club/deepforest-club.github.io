## Localization
You can contribute to our project by doing translation and localization work, which is extremely helpful to us. However, the prerequisite is that you must be familiar with the language to be translated or you are a native speaker of that language. The quality of translation cannot be solely improved through translation tools. We greatly appreciate contributors who participate in translation and localization work and carefully translate and address issues. It is important to maintain consistency with the original text in terms of language logic and style as much as possible.
